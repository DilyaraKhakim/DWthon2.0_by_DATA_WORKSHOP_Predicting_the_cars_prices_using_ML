# DWthon2_by_DATA_Workshop_Predicting_the_cars_prices_using_ML

The final version of the code that I used while participating the event DWthon2 organised by DATA WORKSHOP (https://dataworkshop.eu; https://dataworkshop.ru) in the 25-26th of September, 2021. 
DWthon2 was dedicated to finding ways how to predict the cars prices using Machine Learning (also the competition on Kaggle was held). 
There was used the real data describing cars (that data have been collected in Poland).
